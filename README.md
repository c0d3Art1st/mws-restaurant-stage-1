# Restaurant Reviews(Stage 1)

**Restaurant Reviews** is a three-stage course material project and part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s new [Mobile Web Specialist](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024) Nanodegree. It is a simple Google Maps-like web-app that offers the user reviews and information about restaurants in New York. It has been implemented with a mobile-first approach that uses responsiveness and caching to make the web-app feel and display well on a range of devices with different screen sizes.

### Project Overview: Stage 1

For stage 1 of the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, a static webpage has incrementally been converted to a mobile-ready web application. It's static design lacked accessibility and had to be converted to a responsive design that displays well on different screen sizes and is accessible for screen reader use. Also, a service worker needed to be implemented to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.



### Usage

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`.
If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
